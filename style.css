/*Style it!*/

/*The page looks pretty plain as it is, and the refactoring we did above to use divs for coffees should give us more flexibility in styling. (Hint: the styling shown in the example below can be achieved purely with bootstrap classes, that is, without custom CSS)*/

table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    margin: 15px 0;
}

td, th {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 5px 10px;
}
