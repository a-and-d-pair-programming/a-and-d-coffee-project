Pilot takes over while co-pilot does not do anything with repo:

Git pull from main branch
git branch newBranchName
git checkout newBranchName
make all changes on this new branch and do these as needed:
    git add .
    git commit -m "meaningful messages"
    git push origin newBranchName
The when its time to switch out go to github and:
    click on create pull request
    marge the pull request, resolving any conflict
Then co-pilot becomes pilot and pilot becomes co-pilot.
